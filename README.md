We applied the SIR filter algorithm as described in the book Probabilistic Forecasting and Bayesian Data Assimilation by Reich & Cotter (2015) on the Lorenz63 model and point vortices.

Functions used for plots are defined in lorenz63.py and vortices.py for their respective models. 
Plots are made in the lorenz63_plots.py and vortices_plots.py

Files starting with trials are earlier incomplete versions of lorenz.py and vortices.py mixed with some plots
